\addchaptertocentry{\acknowledgementname} % Add the acknowledgements to the table of contents
I want to thank my thesis instructor Dr. Kendra Burbank for her guidance and support during the past eight months. She is the best instructor I have ever met, who always patiently encouraged me when I was faced with academic challenges. From her, I learned not only the procedure and tips for research but also the importance of curiosity about the unknown. She has invited me to her house several times to further discuss my thesis, which is a welcoming gesture that I have not experienced before in my previous interactions with academic faculty. Dr.Burbank also makes me want a Ph.D. since I want to be a positive person like her in the future.

I want to thank my parents for supporting me financially and spiritually for my study here. Thinking of them will always warm my heart during my stay in Chicago.

I also want to thank my friends who listened to my interim results and hanged out with me for a study break.
